# Elemental Conquest – A Web3 Skill-Based Battle Royale

🌌 **Elemental Conquest** is a Web3 Battle Royale game inspired by the Five Elements philosophy. Players take on the role of elemental warriors—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, or Earth—in a post-Big Bang shattered universe, fighting to survive and conquer using pure skill.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Web3 Battle Royale**: 100-player PvP matches, loot drops, shrinking zones, survival gameplay.
- **PvE and PvP Modes**: Accessible for new players, yet challenging for seasoned gamers.
- **Five Element System**: Elemental affinities counter each other, and coordinated teams activate the powerful "Five Elements Formation".
- **NFT Crafting**: Use $CUP tokens and battle-collected materials to craft NFT weapons and skins.
- **Dual Token Economy**:
  - `$CUP`: Core governance and premium crafting token.
  - `$CC`: Secondary token for basic cosmetics and participation rewards.
- **Community DAO**: $CUP holders shape the game’s development direction.
- **AI Anti-Cheat**: Real-time behavior monitoring, auto-ban system for cheaters and bots.
